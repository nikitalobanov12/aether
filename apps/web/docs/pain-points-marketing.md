**For Landing Page, Ads, Emails, Social**

## PAIN POINT #1: Calendar Sync That Breaks

### The Problem
*"Todoist's calendar sync is broken. Tasks appear in the app but not in Google Calendar. Or they create duplicates. I have 3 'Buy groceries' tasks in my calendar now."*

### Why It Matters
- Calendar is source of truth for most people
- Broken sync = tasks get forgotten
- Duplicates create decision paralysis

### Your Solution
**"Your Calendar and Tasks, Finally in Sync"**

Unlike other apps, our calendar integration works. Complete a task here, and it disappears from your calendar. Instantly. No duplicates. No sync delays.

---

## PAIN POINT #2: Accomplishments Disappear

### The Problem
*"I complete a task and… it vanishes. How am I supposed to feel motivated? I have no idea what I did this week."*

### Why It Matters
- Humans need to see progress for motivation
- Weekly reviews drive productivity
- Task history = reference for planning

### Your Solution
**"See What You Actually Accomplished"**

Other apps let you do work but not review it. We built a weekly review showing everything you completed, grouped by goal, with your progress tracked. Finally, motivation backed by data.

---

## PAIN POINT #3: Tasks Don't Connect to Goals

### The Problem
*"Todoist is a giant flat list. Where do my tasks fit in my actual life? I have a goal to 'launch my app,' but my tasks are 'buy milk,' 'call dentist'—all mixed together."*

### Why It Matters
- People need structure to feel organized
- Knowing tasks support goals is motivating
- Without hierarchy, everything feels equally important

### Your Solution
**"Goals → Projects → Daily Tasks. Connected."**

Create your big-picture goals. Break them into projects. Then focus on today's tasks. See exactly how your daily work contributes to what matters.

---

## PAIN POINT #4: AI That Takes Over

### The Problem
*"Motion's AI scheduled my entire day without asking. It said I should work 2-4pm but I have a meeting at 2:30pm. I deleted the app after a week."*

### Why It Matters
- People need control over their own schedule
- AI is only helpful if it respects human judgment
- Forced automation feels dystopian

### Your Solution
**"Smart Suggestions, Not Forced Scheduling"**

AI should help you think, not think for you. Our app suggests how to break down tasks, highlights what's due, and asks if you want help prioritizing. But you're always in control.

---

## PAIN POINT #5: Too Expensive

### The Problem
*"Sunsama is $18/month. Morgen is $25/month. Both have bugs. I'm paying premium prices for features Todoist has at 1/5 the cost."*

### Why It Matters
- Solo users have limited budgets
- Price signals quality
- High price + bugs = broken trust

### Your Solution
**"Full-Featured for $8/Month"**

Sunsama: $18/mo. Morgen: $25/mo. We offer everything—calendar sync, goal hierarchy, completed task history, optional AI—for $8/month. Same price as a coffee. Better features than apps costing 3x more.

**Free Plan**: 50 tasks, 2 goals, basic sync
**Pro Plan**: $8/month or $80/year (unlimited everything)

## COMPETITOR POSITIONING

### vs Todoist
Todoist is amazing at **task capture**, but:
- Calendar sync is broken
- Can't see what you accomplished
- Tasks don't connect to goals

**We keep the speed. We fixed the calendar. We added goal structure.**

### vs Motion
Motion promised AI magic, but users say:
- **Slower than planning myself**
- Takes over my schedule
- Too complex for what it delivers

**We do AI differently—suggestions only. And it's $8/mo, not $25.**

### vs Sunsama
Sunsama is beautiful, but:
- **$18/month is steep for solo users**
- Sync issues at premium tier
- Lacks goal hierarchy

**We offer everything at $8/month.**

## KEY COPY PRINCIPLES

1. **Be Specific** - "Calendar sync is broken" beats "better integration"
2. **Name Competitors** - Specificity builds trust
3. **Lead with Pain** - Problems first, solutions second
4. **Show Progress** - Completed task visibility is motivational
5. **Undercut Price** - $8 < $18 is powerful
6. **Respect Autonomy** - "You decide" beats "AI decides"

## FINAL NOTE

The strongest marketing copy comes directly from user pain. These pain points are real, from real Reddit complaints. Use them verbatim—users recognize their own frustrations and think: "Finally, someone gets it."
