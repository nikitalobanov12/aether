# Marketing & Product Strategy

**Updated: January 2026 | Product-First, Not Anti-AI**

## POSITIONING (Final)

### The Promise

_"I can see my goals. I see the projects. I see today's tasks. All connected. My calendar shows it all. When I finish something, updates everywhere. AI helps me break things down. I decide what to do. And at week's end, I see what I accomplished."_

**That app doesn't exist yet. You're building it.**

---

### One-Liner

**"Calendar + tasks + goals in one place, designed for solo users."**

---

## THE 5 MARKET GAPS (Your Competitive Advantages)

### Gap #1: Calendar Sync That Doesn't Break

- **Todoist's weakness**: sync is broken, creates duplicates
- **Your advantage**: two-way sync, zero duplicates, tested extensively
- **Price advantage**: Sunsama does this at $18/mo; you do it at $8/mo

### Gap #2: Goals → Projects → Daily Tasks Hierarchy

- **Todoist**: flat task lists (no structure)
- **Linear**: teams only (not personal)
- **Notion**: too flexible (analysis paralysis)
- **Your advantage**: simple 3-level hierarchy, easy to use

### Gap #3: AI That Doesn't Decide Your Schedule

- **Motion's failure**: auto-schedules without permission
- **User rebellion**: "I feel controlled"
- **Your advantage**: suggestions only, user decides

### Gap #4: Completed Task Visibility

- **Every other app**: tasks vanish after completion
- **Users hate this**: no sense of progress
- **Your advantage**: weekly review + history + motivation

### Gap #5: Affordable for Solo Users

- **Sunsama**: $16-20/mo (too expensive)
- **Morgen**: $15-30/mo (too expensive + buggy)
- **Your advantage**: $8/mo or $80/year (best value)

## LAUNCH MESSAGING

### Product Hunt Headline

**"Calendar + Tasks + Goals in One Place. Everything Motion Got Wrong, Todoist Forgot."**

### Landing Page Hero

**Headline**: "Organize Your Goals. Execute Your Day."

**Subheading**: "Finally—a task planner that syncs with your calendar, shows what's next, and lets you see what you actually accomplished."

---

## CORE NARRATIVES (Use These Consistently)

### Narrative 1: "We Fixed Todoist"

Todoist is amazing for task capture, but:

- Calendar sync is **broken** (duplicates, one-way)
- Can't see what you accomplished
- Tasks don't connect to life goals
- Habit tracker loses history

**Our solution**: Todoist's speed + goals + working calendar sync

---

### Narrative 2: "We Fixed Motion"

Motion promised AI magic, but actual users say:

- **Slower than planning myself**
- Auto-scheduling **ignores my reality**
- Too complex for what it delivers
- Aggressive billing without support

**Our solution**: AI that helps, not controls

---

### Narrative 3: "We Built What Was Missing"

No other app:

- Ties goals → projects → daily tasks
- Shows completed task history well
- Has calendar + tasks without breaking one
- Offers all three at affordable price

**Our solution**: The integration everyone asked for

---

## MESSAGING BY AUDIENCE

### For Todoist Users

_"You love Todoist's speed. But you hate broken calendar sync and invisible accomplishments. We kept the speed, fixed the calendar, added goal structure."_

### For Motion Users

_"You tried AI scheduling. It didn't match your reality. We do AI differently—suggestions only, you decide. And it's $8/mo, not $25."_

### For Productivity Nerds

_"This is Linear for personal planning. Minimalist design, integrated calendar, goal hierarchy, completed task visibility. Everything in one place."_

### For Startup Founders

_"You juggle goals, projects, daily tasks across apps. We made one app for all three, with real calendar sync and AI that helps."_

## WHAT TO SAY NO TO

❌ "Let's add 50 more AI features"
❌ "Make Pro tier $15+ to maximize revenue"
❌ "Hide key features behind paywall"
❌ "Build team collaboration first"
❌ "Auto-schedule tasks for users"
❌ "Integrate with every tool under the sun"
❌ "Make it hyper-customizable (analysis paralysis)"

✓ Instead: Keep AI optional, keep pricing competitive, make solo users awesome first

The market is ready. Go build it.
