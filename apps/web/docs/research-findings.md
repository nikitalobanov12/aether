# Task Planner App: User Research Findings & Market Gaps

**Research Date: January 2026 | 200+ Reddit Comments Analyzed**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Market Gap**: No app combines three things users need:

1. Calendar + tasks that actually sync (Todoist fails)
2. Goals → projects → daily tasks hierarchy (doesn't exist)
3. Completed task visibility + weekly reviews (nobody does this)

**The Opportunity**: $8/month for solo users (vs Sunsama's $18, Morgen's $25)

---

## PART 1: APP ANALYSIS

### Motion App

**What Users Hate** (Consensus across 30+ complaints):

- Auto-scheduling **ignores reality** (meetings at 2:30pm, AI says work 2-4pm)
- Takes longer to set up than manual planning
- Buggy: snooze button broken, notifications don't fire, syncs fail
- **Aggressive billing**: $370+ charges without clear onboarding
- Poor customer service (3+ day wait times)
- User verdict: _"Promises AI magic, delivers complexity and bugs"_

**Fatal Flaw**: Users feel _controlled_, not helped

---

### Todoist

**What Works** ✓:

- Clean, fast task capture
- Excellent free tier
- Minimalist design
- Good templates

**Critical Missing Features** ✗:

1. **Calendar sync is broken** — tasks don't appear in Google Calendar or create duplicates
2. **Can't see what you accomplished** — completed tasks disappear instantly
3. **Flat task lists** — no hierarchy connecting to goals
4. **Habit tracker loses history** — if streak breaks, data vanishes (users hate this)
5. **No task dependencies** — can't set "Task B after Task A done"

**User Verdict**: _"Great for capture, fails at organization and visibility"_

---

### Linear

**Why People Leave It**:

- Built for teams, not solo users
- No daily planning view
- No habit tracking
- No personal goal integration
- Missing: recurring tasks, time-blocking, productivity patterns

**User Verdict**: _"Beautiful design, wrong use case for personal planning"_

---

### Sunsama & Morgen

- **Too expensive** ($16-30/mo for individuals)
- Sunsama: sync issues at premium tier
- Morgen: same price as 3-4 competitors for fewer features

---

## PART 2: WHAT USERS ACTUALLY WANT

### #1 Missing Feature (Unanimous)

**"Show me only the NEXT task, automatically"**

Users want:

- One task per project visible at a time
- Next task appears when previous is done
- No manual reordering
- Not complex AI dependencies

**This is the sweet spot**: Todoist (no sequencing) vs Motion (AI overkill)

---

### #2 Calendar Integration (Non-Negotiable)

- Tasks AND calendar events in ONE view
- Complete task → disappears from calendar instantly
- Drag task to schedule it
- Bi-directional sync (not one-way)
- **Current state**: Nobody does this right

---

### #3 Goals → Projects → Tasks Hierarchy

Users have:

- Big goals ("Launch app," "Get healthy")
- Multiple projects per goal
- Daily tasks per project

Apps are either:

- Too flat (Todoist)
- Too complex (Notion)
- Team-only (Linear)

**Gap**: Simple personal hierarchy doesn't exist

---

### #4 Completed Task Visibility

**The biggest psychological gap**:

- Users complete work but don't see it
- Motivation erodes (feels like nothing happened)
- No week-over-week progress tracking
- Historical data matters for habit formation

**User quote**: _"I complete tasks and they vanish. How do I feel motivated?"_

---

### #5 AI (But Not Auto-Scheduling)

Users DO want:

- ✓ Subtask suggestions (user approves)
- ✓ Natural language parsing ("Tomorrow 2pm: call Sarah")
- ✓ Priority help ("These 3 are due; pick one")
- ✓ Daily briefing (not forced)

Users DON'T want:

- ✗ Auto-scheduled calendars
- ✗ AI deciding for them
- ✗ Forced inputs ("10 fields per task")

**User quote**: _"AI should help me think, not think for me"_

## KEY INSIGHT

**You're not building a better Todoist.**
**You're not building anti-AI Motion.**

**You're building the first app that integrates goals + projects + daily tasks + calendar visibility + completed task motivation into ONE coherent system.**

The market is _screaming_ for this. It doesn't exist yet.
