# Backlog

Future enhancements and features to consider implementing.

## High Priority

- [ ] **WASM Scheduler** - C-based constraint solver compiled to WebAssembly for optimal task scheduling. Would handle complex scheduling scenarios with deadlines, priorities, time blocks, and energy levels more efficiently than JavaScript.

- [ ] **Offline Support** - Service worker for offline-first experience with background sync when connection is restored.

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Recurring Task Improvements** - More advanced RRULE support, better UI for complex recurrence patterns.

- [ ] **Mobile PWA** - Optimize for mobile Progressive Web App experience with push notifications.

- [ ] **Batch Operations** - Multi-select tasks for bulk status updates, rescheduling, or deletion.

- [ ] **Task Templates** - Save and reuse common task structures.

- [ ] **Time Tracking Reports** - Weekly/monthly reports on time spent per board, goal, or tag.

## Low Priority

- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Comprehensive keyboard navigation and shortcuts.

- [ ] **Dark Mode Improvements** - Better contrast, custom accent colors.

- [ ] **Import/Export** - Import tasks from Todoist, Notion, etc. Export to various formats.

- [ ] **Integrations** - Slack notifications, Zapier/Make webhooks.

- [ ] **Collaborative Features** - Share boards, assign tasks to others (would require real-time infrastructure).

## Technical Debt

- [ ] **E2E Tests** - Playwright tests for critical user flows.

- [ ] **Performance Monitoring** - Add Sentry or similar for error tracking and performance metrics.

- [ ] **API Rate Limiting** - Protect against abuse with proper rate limiting.
