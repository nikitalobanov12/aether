## THE BIG PICTURE

**You're building the first app where**:
- Goals connect to projects connect to daily tasks
- Calendar + tasks work together (bi-directional)
- You see what you accomplished each week
- AI helps you organize, never decides for you
- Solo users can afford it ($8/month)

**This app doesn't exist yet. Users are screaming for it. Go build it.**

## KEY PRINCIPLES (Copy This Into Your Team Docs)

1. ✓ **Calendar sync must not break** (your #1 differentiator)
2. ✓ **Weekly review must be motivational** (engagement driver)
3. ✓ **Design must be simple** (user retention)
4. ✓ **Price $8/month** (competitive advantage)
5. ✓ **AI suggests, user decides** (builds trust)
6. ✗ **No auto-scheduling** (Motion's fatal flaw)
7. ✗ **No hidden features behind paywall** (Todoist's weakness)
8. ✗ **No feature bloat** (keep it simple)

---

**You're ready. Go build something great.**
