---

## PAIN POINT #1: Calendar Sync That Breaks (Todoist)

### The Problem
**Headline**: "Tasks Don't Actually Sync With Your Calendar"

**User Quote** (from Reddit):
> "Todoist's calendar sync is broken. Tasks appear in the app but not in Google Calendar, or they create duplicates. I have 3 'Buy groceries' tasks in my calendar now."

### What Users Hate
- Duplicate tasks appearing in Google Calendar
- Tasks sync one direction, not both
- Can't control which tasks appear in calendar (recurring tasks clutter everything)
- Manual enabling required; not automatic
- **Result**: Users stop trusting the integration and manage tasks + calendar separately

### Why This Matters
- Calendar is the source of truth for most people
- If tasks don't appear there, they get forgotten
- Duplicates create decision paralysis ("Which one is real?")

### Your Solution
- **Built-in 2-way sync that doesn't break**
- Bi-directional updates: complete in app → removed from calendar
- **Zero duplicates** (verified system)
- No manual setup required
- Tested extensively before launch

### Landing Page Copy
**Headline**: "Your Calendar and Tasks, Finally in Sync"

**Subheading**: "Unlike other apps, our calendar integration works. Complete a task here, and it disappears from your calendar. Instantly. No duplicates."

**CTA**: "See it in action" (video demo)

---

## PAIN POINT #2: You Can't See What You Actually Did (All Apps)

### The Problem
**Headline**: "Your Accomplishments Disappear"

**User Quote** (from Reddit):
> "I complete a task and... it vanishes. How am I supposed to feel motivated? I have no idea what I did this week. I want to see my progress, but the app doesn't help me."

### What Users Hate
- Completed tasks disappear immediately
- No way to review what you accomplished this week
- Can't see patterns in productivity
- No history to reference later
- **Result**: Users feel unmotivated; productivity apps become depressing instead of encouraging

### Why This Matters
- Humans need to see progress to stay motivated
- Weekly reviews are shown to increase productivity (research)
- Seeing what you accomplished is as important as planning what's next

### Your Solution
- **Weekly review showing everything you completed**
- Historical data preserved (all completed tasks visible forever)
- Habit streaks with history (even if streak breaks, history is saved)
- Motivational summary: "You completed 14 tasks this week"
- Visual progress (completion heatmap)

### Landing Page Copy
**Section Title**: "See What You Actually Accomplished"

**Headline**: "Remember What You Did This Week"

**Description**: "Other apps let you do work but not review it. We built a weekly review section that shows everything you completed, how long you spent, and your progress toward bigger goals. Finally, motivation backed by data."

**Visual**: Screenshot of week view with completed tasks highlighted in green, progress bars showing 70% completion rate

**CTA**: "Check the demo"

---

## PAIN POINT #3: Tasks Don't Connect to Life Goals (Todoist)

### The Problem
**Headline**: "Your Tasks Are Disconnected From Your Goals"

**User Quote** (from Reddit):
> "Todoist is a giant flat list of tasks. Where do they fit in my actual life? I have a goal to 'launch my app,' but my tasks are 'buy milk,' 'call dentist,' 'review contract'—all mixed together. There's no structure."

### What Users Hate
- Todoist is purely flat (tasks only, no hierarchy)
- Linear is only for teams (projects, but not personal goals)
- Notion is too flexible (analysis paralysis)
- No way to see how daily tasks build toward bigger goals
- **Result**: Users feel scattered; can't prioritize; lose sight of what matters

### Why This Matters
- Humans need hierarchy to feel organized
- Knowing "this task supports Goal X" is motivating
- Without it, everything feels equally important (nothing feels important)

### Your Solution
- **Goals → Projects → Tasks hierarchy**
- Create life goals (e.g., "Launch Product," "Get Healthier," "Learn Spanish")
- Create projects under goals (e.g., "Design," "Development," "Testing")
- Daily tasks automatically connect to projects → goals
- Visual progress: "3 of 7 tasks done for Launch Product goal"

### Landing Page Copy
**Section Title**: "Your Tasks Should Support Your Goals"

**Headline**: "Goals. Projects. Daily Tasks. Connected."

**Description**: "Create your big-picture goals. Break them into projects. Then focus on today's tasks. See exactly how your daily work contributes to what matters. Finally, a task planner built around your actual life."

**Visual**: Animation showing Goal → Projects → Tasks cascading down

**CTA**: "Learn how to organize your life"

---

## PAIN POINT #4: AI That Takes Over Instead of Helps (Motion)

### The Problem
**Headline**: "AI Scheduling That Ignores Your Real Life"

**User Quote** (from Reddit):
> "Motion's AI scheduled my entire day without asking me. It said I should write code from 2-4pm, but I have a meeting with my boss at 2:30. The AI doesn't know my life. I deleted the app after a week."

### What Users Hate
- Motion auto-schedules without permission
- AI doesn't match real work (interruptions, context switching)
- Takes 10 minutes to set up a simple task
- Feels like the app is controlling you, not helping you
- **Result**: Users feel powerless; revert to manual planning; pay $25/mo for nothing

### Why This Matters
- People need agency over their own schedule
- AI is only helpful if it respects human judgment
- Forced automation feels dystopian, not helpful

### Your Solution
- **AI that suggests, not forces**
- Optional subtask suggestions: "Break this down?" (user approves)
- Daily briefing: "Here's a suggested plan" (not required)
- Natural language parsing: "Tomorrow 2pm: call Sarah" → auto-slots (user can accept/reject)
- Priority help: "These 3 are due soon; which matters most?" (user decides)
- **You always control your schedule**

### Landing Page Copy
**Section Title**: "AI That Actually Respects Your Autonomy"

**Headline**: "Smart Suggestions, Not Forced Scheduling"

**Description**: "AI should help you think, not think for you. Our app suggests how to break down complex tasks, highlights what's due, and asks if you want help prioritizing. But you're always in control. You decide what to do and when."

**Contrast Copy**: "Unlike Motion, we don't auto-schedule your day. Unlike Todoist, we offer helpful AI. Unlike Notion, we're actually designed for daily use."

**CTA**: "See AI done right"

---

## PAIN POINT #5: Too Expensive for What You Get (Sunsama, Morgen)

### The Problem
**Headline**: "Productivity Tools Cost More Than Your Streaming Services"

**User Quote** (from Reddit):
> "Sunsama is $18/month. I like it, but I'm not paying $18 for a task manager when Todoist is $5. Morgen is $25/month and has sync bugs. I feel like I'm being overcharged."

### What Users Hate
- $16-30/month feels expensive for a solo user
- Pricing doesn't match features
- Better alternatives cost 1/3 the price
- Morgen's sync is broken at premium price (feels scammy)
- **Result**: Users stick with cheaper apps even if they're inferior

### Why This Matters
- Indie users have limited budgets
- Perceived value matters more than actual features
- Price signals quality; high price + bugs = broken trust

### Your Solution
- **$8/month or $80/year (17% annual discount)**
- Full features available (not locked behind premium)
- Free tier is actually useful (not crippled)
- Price reflects value, not ego

### Landing Page Copy
**Section Title**: "Actually Affordable"

**Headline**: "The Full-Featured Task Planner for $8/Month"

**Description**: "Sunsama is $18/month. Morgen is $25/month. Both have issues. We offer everything you need—calendar sync, goal hierarchy, completed task history, optional AI—for $8/month. Same price as a coffee. Better features than apps costing 3x more."

**Pricing Card**:
```
Free Plan: $0
- Up to 50 tasks
- Calendar sync
- 2 goals
- Weekly review

Pro Plan: $8/month
- Unlimited tasks
- Unlimited goals
- All features
- Priority support
```

**CTA**: "Start free, upgrade when ready"

## PAIN POINT #6: No "Next Task" Clarity (All Apps)

### The Problem
**Headline**: "Which Task Should I Do First?"

**User Quote** (from Reddit):
> "I open my task app and see 30 tasks. I don't know where to start. Is it the deadline? Priority? Effort level? I end up scrolling for 10 minutes deciding, then I'm demoralized before I even start."

### What Users Hate
- Too many choices visible at once
- No automatic "next task" indication
- Have to manually sort/filter
- Overwhelming interface leads to analysis paralysis
- **Result**: Users procrastinate instead of acting

### Why This Matters
- Decision fatigue kills productivity
- Clarity enables action
- One task is better than 30 options

### Your Solution
- **"Next Up" task highlighted at the top**
- Automatic: complete task → next one appears
- Remove all other tasks from immediate view (collapse)
- Focus on what's next, not everything

### Landing Page Copy
**Section Title**: "Stop Deciding, Start Doing"

**Headline**: "Always Know Your Next Task"

**Description**: "Our app shows you one task at a time: the 'Next Up' task. It's highlighted. It's clear. Complete it, and the next one appears. No scrolling. No deciding. Just action."

**Visual**: Before/after screenshot. Before: cluttered task list. After: clean, one task highlighted.

**CTA**: "Experience simplicity"

## PAIN POINT #7: Habit Tracking That Deletes Your History (Todoist)

### The Problem
**Headline**: "Your Habit Streak Breaks, Your History Disappears"

**User Quote** (from Reddit):
> "I tracked my Exercise habit in Todoist. Had a 12-day streak. Missed one day and... my entire history is gone. Just a blank slate. I felt like a failure. Why would an app delete my history?"

### What Users Hate
- Habit streaks reset brutally
- No memory of effort before the break
- Demoralizing when streak breaks
- No way to see "I had 12 days, broke it, came back"
- **Result**: Users abandon habit tracking entirely

### Why This Matters
- Resilience matters more than perfection
- Humans need to see effort even when it's imperfect
- Breaking a streak is demoralizing; deleting history is worse

### Your Solution
- **Habit history preserved forever**
- Show streaks with breaks: "14 days, break on day 15, resumed day 16"
- Visual calendar showing all attempts (GitHub-style)
- Motivational messaging: "You came back. That matters."

### Landing Page Copy
**Section Title**: "Habits That Stick (And Don't Delete Your Work)"

**Headline**: "Streak Breaks Happen. Your History Shouldn't Disappear."

**Description**: "Most apps delete your habit history when a streak breaks. We keep it. See all your attempts, your resilience, your effort. One missed day doesn't erase 14 days of work."

**Visual**: Habit history showing 14-day streak, break, 6-day streak, with dates labeled

**CTA**: "Build habits that last"

---

## PAIN POINT #8: Too Complex to Set Up (Motion)

### The Problem
**Headline**: "It Takes Forever to Add a Simple Task"

**User Quote** (from Reddit):
> "Motion requires you to fill out 10 fields for a task: title, duration, priority, category, tags, time block, due date, notes, recurring pattern, and AI instructions. By the time I finish, I've forgotten why I wanted to do it."

### What Users Hate
- Friction for simple actions
- 10+ data fields per task
- Required fields that don't make sense
- Onboarding is overwhelming
- **Result**: Users don't use the app despite paying for it

### Why This Matters
- Speed is a feature
- Friction kills habit formation
- Simple actions should be simple

### Your Solution
- **Task creation in 3 seconds**
- Only required field: task title
- Optional fields: due date, project, priority
- Natural language input: "Tomorrow 2pm: meeting" = done
- Minimal, elegant interface

### Landing Page Copy
**Section Title**: "Capture Tasks in Seconds"

**Headline**: "No Friction. No 10-Field Forms."

**Description**: "Add a task in 3 seconds. Title is all you need. Everything else is optional. Motion makes you fill out a form. We get out of your way."

**Visual**: Side-by-side video. Left: Motion task form (many fields). Right: Your app (title field only).

**CTA**: "Try the simplicity"
