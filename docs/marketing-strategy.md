# REVISED MARKETING & PRODUCT STRATEGY
## Task Planner App - Built on User Research

**Updated: January 2026**  
**Based on: 200+ Reddit comments, product reviews, user complaints**

## STRATEGIC SHIFT: Product-First, Not Anti-AI

### Original Positioning
**"Linear for Life" - Minimalist anti-AI alternative**

### REVISED Positioning  
**"The Task Planner That Gets Out of Your Way (And Helps When You Need It)"**

---

## WHY THE SHIFT

From user research, people DON'T hate AI. They hate:
- **Motion's forced auto-scheduling** (ignores reality)
- **Complexity marketed as "smart"**
- **Losing control over their own calendar**

People DO want:
- ✓ AI that suggests (not forces)
- ✓ Natural language task capture
- ✓ Subtask breakdowns without thinking
- ✓ Daily briefing + prioritization help
- **BUT: They decide what to work on and when**

## MARKET GAPS (Your Gold Mine)

### Gap #1: Calendar Integration That Actually Works
- Todoist's sync is broken
- Motion's sync is cluttered
- Sunsama does it well ($18/mo)
- **You**: Do it at $8-12/mo

### Gap #2: Goal-Aligned Task Management
- Todoist: flat task lists only
- Linear: teams only
- Notion: too flexible (too much power = paralysis)
- **You**: Simple goal → project → task

### Gap #3: AI That Doesn't Take Over
- Motion: too controlling (user rebellion)
- Todoist: no AI at all
- **You**: Suggestions only, user decides

### Gap #4: Completed Task Visibility
- **NO major app does this well**
- Users want to see what they accomplished
- Motivational + practical for planning
- **You**: Built-in weekly review

### Gap #5: Affordable ($8-12/mo not $16-30)
- Sunsama: $16-20/mo (too expensive for solo)
- Morgen: $15-30/mo (too expensive + buggy)
- Todoist Pro: $5/mo but features hidden behind paywall
- **You**: Full power at $8/mo or $80/year

## LAUNCH POSITIONING (Revised)

### Product Hunt Headline

**OLD IDEA**: "Linear for personal productivity – minimalist, AI-free alternative to Motion"

**BETTER**: "Calendar + Tasks + Goals in One Place. Everything Motion got wrong, Todoist forgot."

OR

"The daily planner that lets you use AI without AI deciding your day"

---

### Landing Page Copy

**Hero Section**
- **Headline**: "Organize Your Goals. Execute Your Day."

**Problems We Solve** (Direct jabs at complaints)
1. ✓ **Calendar integration that doesn't break** (vs Todoist)
2. ✓ **Goals → Projects → Daily Tasks** (vs flat Todoist lists)
3. ✓ **See what you did each week** (vs invisible completed tasks)
4. ✓ **AI suggests, you decide** (vs Motion controlling your schedule)
5. ✓ **Affordable for solo users** (vs $18-30 competitors)

**Features Listed**
- Bi-directional calendar sync (Google Calendar + Google Tasks)
- Next-up task sequencing per project
- Goal-aligned task hierarchy

## MARKETING MESSAGING (Revised)

### Core Narratives

**Narrative 1: "We Fixed Todoist"**
- Todoist is great at task capture, but...
- Calendar sync is broken (duplicates, no two-way)
- Can't see what you accomplished
- Flat tasks don't connect to goals
- We built Todoist + goals + calendar that actually works

**Narrative 2: "We Fixed Motion"**
- Motion promised AI magic
- Actual user feedback: "Slower than planning myself"
- Buggy, expensive, terrible UX
- We built AI that helps without taking over

**Narrative 3: "We Built What Was Missing"**
- No app ties goals → projects → daily tasks
- No app shows completed task history well
- No app has calendar + tasks without breaking one
- We built the integration everyone asked for

## REVISED PRODUCT ROADMAP

### MVP (What Actually Matters)

**1. Calendar + Task Integration (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
- **The #1 complaint about Todoist**: Calendar sync is broken
- **Your advantage**: Build it right the first time
- Two-way sync: complete task → disappears from Google Calendar
- View tasks + calendar events in one daily/weekly view
- Drag task to time block to schedule
- No duplicate tasks (Todoist's failure)

**2. "Next Up" Task Sequencing**
- Users want: **Show me one task per project. Automatically.**
- When I complete it, show the next one
- NO complex AI dependencies; just list order
- NO manual clicking through hierarchies
- **This solves the "overwhelm" problem** Todoist creates

**3. Goal → Project → Task Hierarchy**
- Create life goals: "Get fit," "Build app," "Read more"
- Create projects under each goal
- Create daily tasks under projects
- See how checking off a task builds toward a goal
- **Todoist is flat; Linear is team-only. You own this middle ground.**

**4. Daily Planner + Time-Blocking**
- See tomorrow's tasks clearly
- Drag tasks into time blocks (Sunsama does this well)
- If you don't finish, reschedule easily
- Quick check-off interface (snappy UX like Todoist)

**5. Google Tasks + Calendar Sync**
- Your stated requirement: sync to both
- Build it with zero duplicates
- Test extensively before launch (Todoist didn't)

### Post-MVP Additions (Based on Demand)

**6. "What Did I Actually Do?" Section**
- **#1 missing feature across all apps**
- See completed tasks from today/week/month
- View time spent per category
- Habit streak tracking (with history)
- **This is motivational AND practical**

**7. Lightweight AI (The Right Way)**
- **Suggest subtasks**: "Break down 'plan trip'" → flights, hotels, activities
  - User approves before adding
  - No forcing
- **Natural language parsing**: "Tomorrow 2pm: call with Sarah" → auto-slots to calendar
- **Daily briefing**: "Based on your goals, here's a suggested plan" (not forced)
- **Prioritization help**: "These 3 tasks are due soon; which matters most?"
- **Never** auto-schedule or decide for user

**8. Habit Tracking**
- Daily/weekly goals
- Streak history (never delete, even if streak breaks)
- Link to tasks (e.g., "Exercise" habit shows workout tasks)
- Users love Tiimo/TickTick for this; Todoist's is broken

## WHAT TO SAY NO TO

- ❌ "Let's add more AI features to compete with Motion"
- ❌ "Make the Pro plan $15+ to increase revenue"
- ❌ "Let's build team collaboration first"
- ❌ "Auto-schedule tasks for users"
- ❌ "Hide key features behind premium tier"
- ❌ "Integrate with 50 apps nobody uses"
- ❌ "Make it customizable with 100 settings"

Instead:
- ✓ Keep AI helpful, not controlling
- ✓ Competitive pricing = growth
- ✓ Solo users first, teams later
- ✓ User decides when/what to do
- ✓ Free tier is actually useful
- ✓ Deep integration with the 3 tools people use: Google Calendar, Google Tasks, Todoist
- ✓ Smart defaults, easy customization

## THE MARKETING PROMISE

You're not building "Linear for Life."
You're not building "Anti-AI Todoist."

**You're building the first app that makes this sentence true**:

"I can see my goals. I can see the projects. I can see today's tasks. They're all connected. My calendar shows it all. When I finish something, it updates everywhere. AI helps me break down complex work. But I decide what to do and when. And at the end of the week, I can see what I actually accomplished."

**That app doesn't exist yet.**

The market is *screaming* for it.
